# Rho-assembly interpreter

This is the lowest level of the bootstrap process. It implements a minimalistic
parser for Rho-assembly, and importantly it implements enough of a VM for
Rho-assembly to carve out a meaningful runtime environment and begin executing
the standard library.

See `../rho-asm` for details about the Rho assembly format.
