#!/usr/bin/env rho
Rho isn't strictly lexical or dynamic with its scoping; different things behave
differently. One example of this is messages, which are mostly lexically
scoped. For instance:

def.foo 5
[1, 2, 3].each x: say x + foo   # prints 6 \n 7 \n 8

Here, the 'foo' message in the block is forwarded to the innermost lexical
frame that defines it. This logic is handled by the StackFrame object, which
acts as the initial receiver of the message.
